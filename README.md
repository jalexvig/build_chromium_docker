Dockerfile for building chromium.

Taken largely from [here](https://gist.github.com/tabiodun/e4204ab83b3b7cfd2d28b478cf441162).

Most of these instructions come from the chromium [build docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_build_instructions.md).

A version of the chromedriver that supports sending keys to a headless chrome is also included.
